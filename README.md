# Krazy-Kanban-Board


  ## Description
  To create a secure Kanban board, we'll implement a system requiring secure user authentication via a login page. Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) will be issued to the user, acting as a digital key to access the Kanban board and its features. This token will be stored securely client-side (e.g., in local storage or a cookie) and included in subsequent requests to the server. The backend will then verify the JWT's validity before granting access to any data or functionality related to the Kanban board, ensuring that only authorized users can view and manipulate tasks. This approach ensures that the Kanban board is protected from unauthorized access, as the user is required to authenticate and the server constantly verifies the authenticity of each request. This will allow users to manage their tasks with peace of mind, knowing their data is secure.

  ## Requirements


  ## Installation
To download the source code from a GitHub repository first navigate to the main page of the repository you are interested in. Once there look to the right side of the file list and click on the "Releases" section. This will take you to the Releases page where you can find various versions of the project. At the top of this page click on the "Tags" option to see different tagged releases. Finally to download the source code simply click on the zip file link provided.

  ## Usage
To ensure secure access to your Kanban board and protect sensitive task information, implementing a login page secured with JWT (JSON Web Token) is a vital step. This will allow only authenticated users to view and manage tasks. The login process will involve verifying user credentials against a database or authentication provider, upon successful verification, a JWT will be generated and sent to the user's browser. This token will then be included in subsequent requests to the Kanban board, allowing the server to verify the user's identity without repeatedly requiring login credentials. A well-implemented JWT-based authentication system provides a robust and scalable security layer for your task management workflow.
